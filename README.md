# ConsoleTable
A [blog](https://github.com/SoupyzInc/ConsoleTable/wiki) on how I made a library that can help create beautiful, easy-to-use tables for console applications. This project is heavily inspired by [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectresystems/spectre.console) by [Patrik Svensson](https://github.com/patriksvensson). Go check him and his project out!
